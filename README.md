# Person-detection-and-tracking
This project implements a robust person detection and tracking system using YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking. The system processes video files, detects people, and tracks their movements across frames, assigning unique IDs to each tracked individual. This project is designed to run in a Google Colab environment.
